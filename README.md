saccadicAdaptation
==================

This was an undergrad project relating to detecting adaptation in saccadic motion planning in response to simulated motor error.

It's frankly a bit embarrassing, this is just a code dump because I needed to clear up a hard drive.

The .tex files are lost to the mists of time but the final writeup can be found [in this repo](./writeup.pdf).
